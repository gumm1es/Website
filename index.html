                Although these girls are smiling, a lot of people who are overweight don't have much to smile about. The reason they got that weight and the fact that they are that weight. This can and most likely will lead to poor mental health. A lot of people stop loving them-selves and just wish they didn't have that extra weight. A lot of people who end up being 'fat' are mainly that way because they went through something and used food to help cope. Obviously genetics play a huge role into how you're originally shaped and how fast your metabolism is which also effects how much weight you hold onto, but still, you need to turn to healthier alternatives which will be talked more about later.

            <p> You need to be able to like what you see in the mirror no matter what. Although mainly a persons confidence is from their parents and peers especially as a kid and through adolecence, no matter what age you are you need to be able to stick by your-self. You are only with YOU forever, why make your time with your-self painful and agonizing.</p>

              <p> Here are some links that can help with getting healthy. Obviously every persons body works differently but this is most definitley a way to get started. The first link is just a little starter for beginners who want to do something </p>
              <a href="https://familydoctor.org/what-you-can-do-to-maintain-your-health/">Healthy site 1</a>
            <p> The second link is a gym that can help. If you believe that you might get ridiculed at the gym then find a way to work out at home because your main goal is to get healthy, no matter how others see you. Also if you find the right gym then you'll most likely just get help and not really be embaressed to be there. </p>
